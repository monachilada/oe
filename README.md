# Ø

## Ø — An øpinionated Wordpress theme
### or: How I learned to stop worrying and love UTF-8

Ø is the 28th letter of the Danish and Norwegian alphabet. While in English it is commonly referred to as an "O Slash", it is usually — in cases where latin only characters can be used, for example in some cases of file names or URLs — represented using two letters together: OE. In honour of our Danish and Norwegian friends, we decided to create a Wordpress theme named Ø, to not only pay homage to it's history, but to enlighten others of it's versatility and general usefulness.
